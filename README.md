# Recap
The aim of this project, is to create a bot that intergrates with Teams and Stream taking relavant notes and summarising them. Meetings are the lifeblood of what we do at Microsoft. At times, it can be daunting, keeping up with the overload of information and key action tasks. RECAP aims to tackle this issue, by pulling meeting transcripts, sanitising data then applying a TLDR* algoritm to summarise the key points of that meeting. After this information is processed, the bot will post this summary in the respective teams meeting chat, ensuring all participants have future reference of key points and actions. Filtering any communication flaws possible.

*TLDR: acronym for 'Too Long, Didn't Read'
